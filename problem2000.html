        <h3>Problem #1 Fast Adder</h3>
        
        <p><label>Background Information:</label>There is a story of a grade school teacher who gave his class                  the problem of adding the first one hundred positive integers:</p>
            <pre>1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 98 + 99 + 100 =</pre>
        <p>A seven year-old boy immediately answered 5050 which is correct.  The child prodigy Carl Friedrich                Gauss developed into one of the greatest mathematicians of all time.  Your computer program will be              able to produce sums faster than Gauss could.</p>
        <label>Programming Problem:</label>
        <p>INPUT &minus; Input from the keyboard a positive integer N &lt; 32,767.</p>

        <p>OUTPUT &minus; Output to the screen the value N and the sum of the first N positive integers.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLE &minus; The following are examples with the input values in bold type.</p>
    
        <p>Input: 5</p>

        <p>Output: N = 5		SUM = 15</p>


        <p>Input: 100</p>

        <p>Output: N = 100	SUM = 5050</p>
