        <h3>Problem #1 Is Your Team The Sum of a Bunch of Squares?</h3>
        
        <p><label>Background Information:</label>It is fairly well known that the sum of the first N positive                       integers is N(N + 1) / 2. In other words, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-2) + (N-1) + N = N(N + 1)/2.
                  Lesser known is that the sum of the first N perfect squares is N(N + 1)(2N + 1)/6. In other                       words, 
                  1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + ... + N2 = N(N + 1)(2N + 1)/6.</p>
        <label>Programming Problem:</label>
        <p>INPUT- 	A positive integer N #&lt; 1000, from file input1.</p>
        <p>OUTPUT-	The sum of the first N squares, to file output1.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLE-	Input:	5</p>
		<p>Output:	55</p>
