        <h3>Problem #1 Is Your Team The Sum of a Bunch of Cubes?</h3>
        
        <p><label>Background Information:</label>It is fairly well known that the sum of the first N positive integers is N (N + 1) / 2. In other words, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + (N-2) + (N-1) + N = N (N + 1 ) / 2.

Less well known is that the sum of the first N positive perfect squares is N (N + 1) (2N + 1) / 6. In other words, 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + ... + N<sup>2</sup> = N (N + 1) (2N + 1) / 6.

            Even lesser well known is that the sum of the first N positive perfect cubes is (N (N + 1) / 2)<sup>2</sup>. In other words, 1 + 8 + 27 + 64 + ... + N<sup>3</sup> = (N (N + 1) / 2)<sup>2</sup>.
