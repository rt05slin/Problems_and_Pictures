        <p><label>Background Information:</label>In this problem, you will be given two cards from a regulation 52-card deck.  However, the deck has had all of its face cards (Kings, Queens, and Jacks) removed.  Your job will be to decide which card is greater.  When comparing two cards, Aces are high, and twos are low.  The card values will range from [1, 10], with 1 for an Ace, 2 for a Two, etc.  If two cards have the same value, the suits will be compared according to the following standard:</p>
            <pre>CLUBS &lt; DIAMONDS &lt; HEARTS &lt; SPADES</pre>
        <p>These four suits will be represented by C, D, H, and S respectively. You will not be given the same card twice as input.Your output will be the name of the higher card, in text form (all capital letters) with one space between each word.
